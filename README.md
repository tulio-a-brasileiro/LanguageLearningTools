# LanguageLearningTools
In this repository you can find tools that can be used for language learning.

Currently you can find:

## 01 - SubtitleConverter (OpenSource) - XML to TXT

This code allows you to input a XML subtitle file and convert it into a TXT file as output. 
The resulting text file will have timestamps removed and broken sentences joined into single, coherent sentences. 
The output is a clean, readable text file.
I created this code to support my language learning journey, allowing me to easily process subtitles extracted from TV series or movies.


## 02 - SubtitleConverter (OpenSource) - VTT to TXT

This code allows you to input a VTT subtitle file and convert it into a TXT file as output. 
The resulting text file will have timestamps removed and broken sentences joined into single, coherent sentences. 
The output is a clean, readable text file.
I created this code to support my Gaelic-Irish learning journey, allowing me to easily process subtitles extracted from Irish-language TV series like Ros na Rún and Saol Ella, both available on TG4.

Bhuel, dá gcloisfeá í.
