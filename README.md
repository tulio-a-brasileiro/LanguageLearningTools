Currently you can find:

/-----------------------------------------------------/
01 - SubtitleConverter (OpenSource) - XML to TXT

This code lets you input a VTT subtitle and as an output you'll have it converted into a TXT file without the timestamp and broken sentences joined as single sentences.
I created this code to help me with my Language Learning journey, so I can upload subtitles extracted from TV series or movies.

02 - SubtitleConverter (OpenSource) - VTT to TXT

This code lets you input a VTT subtitle and as an output you'll have it converted into a TXT file without the timestamp and broken sentences joined as single sentences. 
I created this code to help me with my Irish Learning, so I can upload subtitles extracted from TV series such as Ros na Rún or Saol Ella. Both available on TG4.

Link for Ros na Rún: https://www.tg4.ie/en/player/online-boxsets/?series=Saol%20Ella&genre=Cula4
Link for Saol Ella: https://www.tg4.ie/en/player/categories/drama-tv-shows/?series=Ros%20na%20R%C3%BAn&genre=Drama

-Example:
Input:
08:57.280 --> 09:00.200
Cruinniú clainne
faoi cheann 10 nóiméad.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.280
Bhuel, dá gcloisfeá í.

Output:
Cruinniú clainne faoi cheann 10 nóiméad.
Bhuel, dá gcloisfeá í
